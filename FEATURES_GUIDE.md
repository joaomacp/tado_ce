## 📊 API Management

**Available:** v1.0.0+ | **Requirement:** None | **Always Enabled**

API Management provides real-time tracking of your Tado API usage, helping you avoid rate limiting and understand your API consumption patterns.

### Overview

Tado enforces API rate limits (100-20,000 calls/day depending on your plan). The official Home Assistant integration doesn't show actual usage, leaving users unaware until they get blocked. Tado CE solves this by:

- Reading actual rate limit data from Tado API response headers
- Automatically detecting your daily limit (100/1000/20000)
- Tracking when your limit resets each day
- Maintaining a history of all API calls
- Providing test mode to simulate low quota scenarios

### Sensors

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `sensor.tado_ce_api_usage` | calls | Current API calls used today |
| `sensor.tado_ce_api_limit` | calls | Your daily API call limit |
| `sensor.tado_ce_api_remaining` | calls | Remaining calls until reset |
| `sensor.tado_ce_api_reset` | timestamp | When your limit resets |
| `sensor.tado_ce_next_sync` | timestamp | Next scheduled API sync time (v2.0.0) |
| `sensor.tado_ce_polling_interval` | minutes | Current polling interval (v2.0.0) |
| `sensor.tado_ce_call_history` | count | API call history with statistics (v2.0.0) |
| `sensor.tado_ce_api_call_breakdown` | text | API call breakdown by endpoint type (v2.0.0) |
| `sensor.tado_ce_api_status` | text | API connection status |

### API Status States

| State | Meaning | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| `ok` | All good | API quota usage < 80% |
| `warning` | High usage | API quota usage > 80% |
| `rate_limited` | Quota exhausted | API quota = 0 remaining |
| `error` | Connection issue | Failed to read rate limit data |
| `unavailable` | Sensor not ready | During HA restart/reload |

### Configuration

**API History Retention:**
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE
2. Click "Configure"
3. Set "API History Retention" (0-365 days, default: 14)
4. Set to 0 for unlimited retention

**Test Mode (v2.0.2+):**
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE
2. Click "Configure"
3. Enable "Enable Test Mode"
4. Integration will fully simulate a 100 call/day API tier

**How Test Mode Works:**
- **Simulated Quota Tracking** - Each API call increments a simulated `used` counter (capped at 100)
- **Single Source of Truth** - All simulated values stored in `ratelimit.json`, read by all components
- **Full Protection Testing** - Quota Reserve (≤5 remaining), Bootstrap Reserve (≤3 remaining), and Adaptive Polling all use simulated values
- **Reset Detection** - When real API reset is detected, simulated counter resets to 0
- **Visibility** - All API sensors show `test_mode: true` attribute when enabled

**Note:** Test Mode is essential for testing quota protection features without actually having a 100 call limit. It simulates the exact behavior you'd experience with a real 100-call API tier.

### Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Monitor API Usage to Avoid Rate Limiting

**Goal:** Get alerted before hitting rate limit.

**Setup:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Alert: API Usage High"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.tado_ce_api_remaining
        below: 20  # Alert when <20 calls remaining
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "⚠️ Tado API Usage High"
          message: >
            Only {{ states('sensor.tado_ce_api_remaining') }} API calls remaining.
            Resets at {{ states('sensor.tado_ce_api_reset') }}.
```

**Benefits:**
- Avoid getting rate limited
- Know when to reduce polling frequency
- Plan manual actions around remaining quota

---

#### Scenario 2: Track API Usage Patterns

**Goal:** Understand which features consume most API calls.

**Setup:**
1. Enable API History with 30-day retention
2. Monitor `sensor.tado_ce_api_usage` over time
3. Check attributes for call breakdown by endpoint

**Example Dashboard Card:**
```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: sensor.tado_ce_api_usage
    name: "Calls Used Today"
  - entity: sensor.tado_ce_api_remaining
    name: "Calls Remaining"
  - entity: sensor.tado_ce_api_limit
    name: "Daily Limit"
  - entity: sensor.tado_ce_api_reset
    name: "Resets At"
```

**Benefits:**
- Identify API-heavy features
- Optimize configuration to reduce calls
- Understand daily usage patterns

---

#### Scenario 3: Test Low Quota Configuration

**Goal:** Test your setup with 100 call/day limit before upgrading plan.

**Setup:**
1. Enable Test Mode in configuration
2. Monitor API usage sensors - they will show `test_mode: true` attribute
3. Adjust polling intervals and optional features
4. Verify quota protection mechanisms work correctly

**Expected Behavior:**
- API limit sensor shows 100 (simulated)
- API usage sensor increments by 1 per API call
- Adaptive polling adjusts to longer intervals as simulated quota decreases
- Quota Reserve pauses polling when simulated remaining ≤5
- Bootstrap Reserve blocks ALL actions when simulated remaining ≤3
- When real API reset is detected, simulated counter resets to 0

**Benefits:**
- Test full quota protection without actually having low quota
- Verify Bootstrap Reserve and Quota Reserve work correctly
- Understand impact of different features on API usage
- Confidence that integration will work correctly when Tado hard-stops at 100 calls

## 🔄 Smart Polling

**Available:** v1.0.0+ | **Requirement:** None | **Always Enabled**

Smart Polling automatically adjusts API polling frequency based on time of day, remaining quota, and your configuration preferences.

### Overview

Smart Polling includes multiple strategies to optimize API usage:

- **Day/Night Polling** - More frequent during day, less at night
- **Adaptive Polling** - Auto-adjusts based on remaining quota
- **Quota Reserve Protection** - Pauses polling when quota critically low, auto-resumes after reset (v2.0.0)
- **Custom Intervals** - Override with fixed intervals
- **Optional Sensors** - Toggle features to save API calls

### Configuration

**Day/Night Schedule:**

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Day Start Hour | 7 | When "day" period starts (0-23) |
| Night Start Hour | 23 | When "night" period starts (0-23) |
| Custom Day Interval | Empty | Fixed interval during day (1-1440 min) |
| Custom Night Interval | Empty | Fixed interval during night (1-1440 min) |

**Optional Sensors:**

| Option | Default | API Calls Saved |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Enable Weather Sensors | Off | 1 call per sync |
| Enable Mobile Device Tracking | Off | 1 call per full sync (every 6h) |
| Enable Home State Sync | Off | Required for Away Mode |

**Other Options:**

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Refresh Debounce Delay | 15 s | Delay before refreshing after user actions |
| Sync Mobile Devices Frequently | Off | Sync mobile devices every quick sync instead of every 6h |

### How It Works

**Adaptive Polling:**
- Automatically adjusts polling speed based on remaining API quota
- Faster polling when quota is healthy
- Slower polling when quota is low
- Keeps 10% safety buffer

**Day/Night Aware Adaptive Polling (v2.0.1):**
- Night period: Fixed 120 min interval (MAX_POLLING_INTERVAL) to conserve quota
- Day period: Adaptive based on remaining quota after reserving Night calls
- Reset Time consideration: If Reset is before Night Start, use all quota until Reset (no need to reserve Night quota)
- Uniform Mode: If Day Start == Night Start, always uses Day (adaptive) polling - useful for 24/7 adaptive polling

**Quota Reserve Protection (v2.0.0):**
- Pauses polling when quota critically low (≤5% or ≤5 calls remaining)
- Reserves quota for manual operations (set temperature, change mode, etc.)
- Automatically resumes polling when API reset time passes
- Prevents "locked out" scenario where polling stops and never resumes

**Bootstrap Reserve Protection (v2.0.1):**
- Hard limit of 3 API calls that are NEVER used, even for manual actions
- Reserved for auto-recovery after API reset
- When triggered: Shows persistent notification "API limit reached. Use the Tado app for emergency changes."
- Notification auto-dismisses when API reset detected

**Day/Night Polling:**
- More frequent updates during day (default 7am-11pm)
- Less frequent updates at night (default 11pm-7am)
- Saves API calls when you're sleeping

### Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Configure Day/Night Polling for Low Quota (100 calls/day)

**Goal:** Stay under 100 calls/day with day/night polling.

**Setup:**
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE → Configure
2. Set Day Start Hour: 7
3. Set Night Start Hour: 23
4. Set Custom Day Interval: 30 minutes
5. Set Custom Night Interval: 120 minutes (2 hours)
6. Disable Weather Sensors
7. Disable Mobile Device Tracking

**Expected API Usage:**
- Day (7am-11pm, 16h): 32 syncs × 2 calls = 64 calls
- Night (11pm-7am, 8h): 4 syncs × 2 calls = 8 calls
- Full sync (every 6h): 4 syncs × 2 calls = 8 calls
- **Total: ~80 calls/day** (20% buffer)

**Benefits:**
- Predictable API usage
- More updates during active hours
- Stays well under 100 call limit

---

#### Scenario 2: Use Custom Intervals for Predictable Polling

**Goal:** Consistent polling every 10 minutes regardless of quota.

**Setup:**
1. Set Custom Day Interval: 10 minutes
2. Set Custom Night Interval: 10 minutes
3. Leave other options default

**Result:**
- Polls every 10 minutes 24/7
- ~288 calls/day (requires 500+ quota)
- Adaptive polling can still override if quota runs low

**Benefits:**
- Predictable polling schedule
- Consistent dashboard updates
- Automatic protection if quota drops

---

#### Scenario 3: Disable Optional Sensors to Save API Calls

**Goal:** Minimize API usage by disabling non-essential features.

**Setup:**
1. Disable "Enable Weather Sensors" (saves 1 call/sync)
2. Disable "Enable Mobile Device Tracking" (saves 1 call/full sync)
3. Keep "Enable Home State Sync" disabled unless using Away Mode

**API Calls Saved:**
- Weather: ~144 calls/day (at 10 min intervals)
- Mobile: ~4 calls/day (at 6h full sync)
- **Total saved: ~148 calls/day**

**Benefits:**
- Significant API usage reduction
- Still have core climate control
- Can re-enable features if quota increases

---

#### Scenario 4: Adaptive Polling for High Quota (1000+ calls/day)

**Goal:** Maximum update frequency with automatic quota protection.

**Setup:**
1. Set Custom Day Interval to 1 minute (for fastest updates)
2. Enable all optional sensors
3. Adaptive polling will protect if quota runs low

**Result:**
- Polls every 1 minute when custom interval set (v2.0.2+)
- ~1440+ calls/day with all features at 1-minute polling
- Automatically slows down if quota drops critically low

**Benefits:**
- Near real-time updates for high-quota users
- Never runs out of quota (adaptive override protection)
- Explicit opt-in for aggressive polling

Bedroom - Last Week:
  Heating Rate: 0.025°C/min ✅
  Preheat Time: 60 minutes ✅
  
Bedroom - This Week:
  Heating Rate: 0.012°C/min ⚠️ (dropped 53%)
  Preheat Time: 130 minutes ⚠️ (increased 117%)
  → Possible issue: Radiator valve stuck, boiler flow temp low, air in system
```

**Action:**
1. Check radiator valve is fully open
2. Bleed radiators (remove air)
3. Check boiler flow temperature
4. Verify TRV battery level
5. Check for furniture blocking radiator

## 📊 Adaptive Smart Polling

**Available:** v2.0.0+ | **Requirement:** None | **Always Enabled**

Adaptive Smart Polling automatically adjusts API polling interval based on remaining quota and time until reset.

### How It Works

**Formula:**
```
Interval = (Time Until Reset / Remaining Calls) / Safety Buffer

Where:
  Safety Buffer = 0.90 (keep 10% reserve)
  Adaptive Floor = 5 minutes (default minimum)
  Max Interval = 120 minutes
```

### Configuration

**Polling Interval Options:**

| Mode | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Adaptive (Recommended) | Auto-adjusts based on quota, minimum 5 min | Default - works for all quota tiers |
| Custom Interval | Fixed interval (1-1440 min) | Override when you want specific polling |

**Set Custom Interval:**
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE
2. Click "Configure"
3. Set Custom Day/Night Interval (1-1440 minutes)
4. Restart Home Assistant

**Note:** 
- Without custom interval: Adaptive polling uses 5-minute minimum (sensible default)
- With custom interval: You can set as low as 1 minute for high-quota users (v2.0.2+)
- Adaptive polling can still override custom interval if quota is critically low

### Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: High Quota Tier (1000+ calls/day)

**Situation:**
- Quota: 1000 calls/day
- Remaining: 4500 calls
- Time until reset: 12 hours

**Adaptive Calculation:**
```
Interval = (720 min / 4500) / 0.90 = 0.16 / 0.90 = 0.18 minutes
Clamped to MIN_INTERVAL = 5 minutes
```

**Result:** Polls every 5 minutes (maximum frequency)

**Benefits:**
- Near real-time updates
- Never runs out of quota
- Automatically slows down if usage spikes

---

#### Scenario 2: Low Quota Tier (100 calls/day)

**Situation:**
- Quota: 100 calls/day
- Remaining: 50 calls
- Time until reset: 12 hours

**Adaptive Calculation:**
```
Interval = (720 min / 50) / 0.90 = 14.4 / 0.90 = 16 minutes
```

**Result:** Polls every 16 minutes

**Benefits:**
- Distributes calls evenly across remaining time
- Prevents running out of quota
- Automatically speeds up after reset

---

#### Scenario 3: Quota Running Low

**Situation:**
- Quota: 1000 calls/day
- Remaining: 10 calls (⚠️ low!)
- Time until reset: 6 hours

**Adaptive Calculation:**
```
Interval = (360 min / 10) / 0.90 = 36 / 0.90 = 40 minutes
```

**Result:** Polls every 40 minutes (slowed down to conserve quota)

**Benefits:**
- Prevents rate limiting
- Ensures some updates until reset
- Automatically speeds up after reset

---

#### Scenario 4: Custom Interval Override

**Situation:**
- You want consistent 10-minute polling
- Quota: 1000 calls/day
- Remaining: 4000 calls

**Setup:**
1. Enable "Custom Polling Interval" = 10 minutes
2. Adaptive polling monitors quota
3. If quota drops below safe threshold, adaptive overrides custom interval

**Result:**
- Normal: Polls every 10 minutes (custom)
- Low quota: Polls every 20+ minutes (adaptive override)

**Benefits:**
- Predictable polling when quota is healthy
- Automatic protection when quota is low

---

## 🔄 Heating Cycle Detection

**Available:** v2.0.0+ | **Requirement:** Zones with heatingPower data | **Always Enabled**

Heating Cycle Detection identifies complete heating cycles (heating ON → target reached → heating OFF) for accurate thermal analysis.

### Configuration

**Cycle Detection:**
- Automatically detects complete heating cycles
- Minimum cycle: 10 minutes
- Maximum cycle: 4 hours
- No configuration needed

**How it works:**
- Monitors when heating turns on
- Tracks temperature rise
- Detects when target is reached
- Analyzes complete cycle for thermal properties

### Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Monitor Heating Efficiency

**Goal:** Track how many cycles complete successfully vs timeout.

**Check Attributes:**
```yaml
sensor.bedroom_thermal_inertia:
  attributes:
    cycle_count: 15  # Total cycles analyzed

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Tado Mode` | Follows per-device "Manual Control" settings in Tado app (default) |
| `Next Time Block` | Override lasts until next scheduled change |
| `Manual` | Infinite override until you manually change back |

**How It Works:**

When you change temperature via Home Assistant (`climate.set_temperature`), the overlay mode determines how long that change lasts:

- **Tado Mode**: Respects the "Manual Control" setting you configured for each device in the Tado app. This is the most flexible option as you can configure different behaviors per device.
- **Next Time Block**: Override automatically ends when the next schedule block starts. Good for temporary adjustments.
- **Manual**: Override stays until you manually switch back to Auto mode. Use this if you want full control.

**Configuring Per-Device Behavior (Tado Mode):**

If using "Tado Mode", configure per-device behavior in the Tado app:
1. Open Tado app → Settings → Rooms & Devices
2. Select a device
3. Manual Control → Choose:
   - "Until next automatic change" (same as Next Time Block)
   - "Until you cancel" (same as Manual)
   - "For a set time" (timer-based)

**API Usage:** 0 calls (local storage only)

**Note:** Default changed from infinite override to Tado Mode in v2.0.2. Users relying on infinite override should either:
- Set Overlay Mode to "Manual", or
- Configure "Until you cancel" in Tado app for each device

### Understanding Geofencing vs Presence Mode

**Important:** Geofencing is a Tado account-level setting configured in the Tado app, not in this integration.

| Scenario | "Auto" Mode Behavior |
|----------|---------------------|
| Geofencing **enabled** in Tado app | Tado automatically switches Home/Away based on mobile device locations |
| Geofencing **disabled** in Tado app | Stays in current state (typically Home) - no automatic switching |

**How Presence Lock Works:**
- **"home" or "away"**: Creates a presence lock that overrides geofencing. Even if geofencing is enabled, Tado won't automatically change the state.
- **"auto"**: Deletes the presence lock. If geofencing is enabled, Tado resumes automatic control. If geofencing is disabled, nothing changes automatically.

**Note:** The "Home/Away State Sync" option in Tado CE integration settings only controls whether the integration syncs the home/away state from Tado - it does not enable or disable geofencing itself.

### Presence Mode Behavior Scenarios

Understanding how "Auto" mode behaves is crucial, especially when geofencing is disabled:

| Initial State | Action | Geofencing ON | Geofencing OFF |
|--------------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Home (locked) | → Auto | Based on phone location | **Stays Home** |
| Away (locked) | → Auto | Based on phone location | **Stays Away** |
| Home (locked) | → Away | Forced Away | Forced Away |
| Away (locked) | → Home | Forced Home | Forced Home |

**Common Misconception:**
```
Home → Away → Auto = Back to Home?  ❌ WRONG (when geofencing OFF)
Home → Away → Auto = Stays Away     ✅ CORRECT (when geofencing OFF)
```

**Why?** When geofencing is disabled, Tado has no way to determine your actual location. The "Auto" option simply removes the presence lock - it doesn't change the presence state. The state remains whatever it was before unlocking.

**Recommendation:** If you have geofencing disabled in the Tado app:
- Use "Home" or "Away" directly instead of "Auto"
- Or use Home Assistant automations with other presence detection (router, BLE, etc.) to control the presence mode

## 🏠 Per-Zone Configuration

**Available:** v2.1.0+ | **Requirement:** None | **Opt-in via Zone Features Toggle**

Per-Zone Configuration allows you to customize settings for each individual zone instead of using global defaults.

### Overview

Previously, settings like overlay mode, temperature limits, and UFH buffer were global. Now you can:
- Set different overlay modes per zone (e.g., Timer for bedroom, Manual for living room)
- Configure temperature limits per zone
- Mark specific zones as UFH for accurate preheat calculations
- Apply temperature offsets for calibration

### Configuration Entities

**Heating Zones Only:**

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `select.{zone}_heating_type` | Select | Radiator or Underfloor Heating |
| `number.{zone}_ufh_buffer` | Number | Extra preheat buffer for UFH (0-60 min) |

**All Climate Zones:**

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `switch.{zone}_adaptive_preheat` | Switch | Enable adaptive preheat for this zone |
| `select.{zone}_smart_comfort_mode` | Select | Weather compensation level |
| `select.{zone}_window_type` | Select | Window insulation for mold risk |
| `select.{zone}_overlay_mode` | Select | How temperature changes behave |
| `number.{zone}_timer_duration` | Number | Timer duration (15-180 min) |
| `number.{zone}_min_temp` | Number | Minimum temperature (5-25°C) |
| `number.{zone}_max_temp` | Number | Maximum temperature (15-30°C) |
| `number.{zone}_temp_offset` | Number | Temperature calibration (-3.0 to +3.0°C) |

### Zone Overlay Mode Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Tado Mode** | Inherit from global setting (default) |
| **Next Time Block** | Revert at next schedule change |
| **Timer** | Revert after timer_duration minutes |
| **Manual** | Stay until manually changed |

### Migration from Global Settings

When upgrading to v2.1.0:
1. Existing `ufh_zones` → Converted to per-zone `heating_type = UFH`
2. Existing `ufh_buffer_minutes` → Copied to per-zone `ufh_buffer`
3. Existing `adaptive_preheat_zones` → Converted to per-zone `adaptive_preheat = ON`
4. Global `overlay_mode` → Remains as default, zones inherit unless overridden

### Use Cases

**Different Overlay Modes:**
```yaml
# Living room: Manual control (stays until changed)
select.living_room_overlay_mode: Manual

# Bedroom: Timer (reverts after 30 min)
select.bedroom_overlay_mode: Timer
number.bedroom_timer_duration: 30

# Office: Next time block (reverts at schedule change)
select.office_overlay_mode: Next Time Block
```

**UFH Zone Configuration:**
```yaml
# Mark bathroom as UFH with 15 min buffer
select.bathroom_heating_type: Underfloor Heating
number.bathroom_ufh_buffer: 15
```

**Temperature Limits:**
```yaml
# Child's room: Limit max temp to 22°C
number.childs_room_max_temp: 22

# Guest room: Allow lower minimum
number.guest_room_min_temp: 12
```

Each HEATING and AIR_CONDITIONING zone gets its own insights sensor: `sensor.{zone}_insights`

- **State**: Number of active insights for this zone (integer)
- **Attributes**:
  - `top_priority` - Highest active priority (none/low/medium/high/critical)
  - `top_recommendation` - Most urgent actionable text for this zone
  - `insight_types` - List of active insight type names
  - `recommendations` - List of all recommendation texts
- **Dynamic icon**: Changes based on highest priority (alert-octagon for critical, alert-circle for high, alert for medium, information for low)
- **Insight types**: mold risk, comfort, window predicted, battery, connection, preheat timing, schedule deviation, heating anomaly, condensation, overlay duration, frequent override, heating off cold, early start disabled, thermal efficiency, schedule gap, boiler flow anomaly, humidity trend, device limitation

Unlike the hub-level Home Insights sensor, zone insights focus only on the specific zone and do not include cross-zone or API-level insights.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Thermal Analytics Shows "Unknown"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Zone doesn't report heatingPower data (rare - most HEATING zones do)
2. Not enough heating cycles collected (need 3-5 cycles)
3. HeatingCycleCoordinator not initialized
4. Heating always on (no complete cycles)

**Solution:**
1. Check if zone has heatingPower: Look at `sensor.{zone}_heating` entity
2. Wait 2-3 days for data collection
3. Check HA logs for coordinator warnings
4. Verify `cycle_count` attribute > 0
5. Ensure heating turns on/off regularly (not always on or always off)
6. Check `data_points` or `cycle_count` attribute to see how much data is available

**Note (v2.0.1):** Thermal Analytics is now available for ALL zones with heatingPower data, including SU02 Smart Thermostat zones.

### Issue: Inaccurate Thermal Analytics Values

**Possible Causes:**
1. Low confidence - Check `_analysis_confidence` sensor
2. Recent changes - Moved furniture, changed radiator settings, weather changed
3. External heat sources - Solar gain, cooking, people
4. Not enough heating cycles analyzed

**Solution:**
- Wait for confidence to reach >80%
- Values will stabilize after 5-10 heating cycles
- Check for external factors affecting temperature
- Avoid making changes to room during data collection period

---

### Issue: Heating Efficiency >200%

**This is normal!** High efficiency means you're getting free heat from:
- ☀️ Solar gain (sun through windows)
- 🍳 Internal heat sources (cooking, appliances, people)
- 🌡️ Warmer outdoor temperature
- 🪟 Better insulation (windows/doors closed)

**Interpretation:**
- **100%** = Normal heating (as expected)
- **<75%** = Slow heating (possible issue: open window, poor insulation, cold weather)
- **>125%** = Fast heating (external heat sources helping) ✅

**Action:**
- No action needed if efficiency is high
- Consider reducing heating target to save energy
- Use historical deviation to detect free heat patterns

---

### Issue: Mold Risk Always Shows "Room Temperature"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Outdoor temperature entity not configured
2. Outdoor temperature sensor unavailable
3. Window type not set

**Solution:**
1. Configure outdoor temperature entity in integration settings
2. Verify outdoor sensor is working: Check `sensor.outdoor_temperature`
3. Set window type in integration settings
4. Check `temperature_source` attribute - should show "surface_estimation"
5. If using weather integration, ensure it provides temperature data

---

### Issue: Adaptive Polling Too Slow

**Possible Causes:**
1. Low remaining quota
2. Custom interval set too high
3. Many zones consuming quota

**Solution:**
1. Check `sensor.tado_ce_api_usage` - how many calls remaining?
2. Disable custom interval to use pure adaptive
3. Disable optional features (weather, smart comfort) to save quota
4. Consider upgrading Tado subscription for higher quota
5. Check if Test Mode is enabled (simulates 100 call limit)

---

### Issue: Smart Comfort Sensors Not Appearing

**Possible Causes:**
1. Smart Comfort not enabled in configuration
2. Integration not restarted after enabling
3. Not enough historical data collected

**Solution:**

---

### Issue: API Rate Limit Exceeded

**Possible Causes:**
1. Too many manual actions
2. Polling interval too short
3. Too many optional features enabled
4. Multiple Home Assistant instances using same account

**Solution:**
1. Check `sensor.tado_ce_api_remaining` - how many calls left?
2. Increase polling intervals (day/night)
3. Disable optional features:
   - Weather Sensors (saves 1 call/sync)
   - Mobile Device Tracking (saves 1 call/full sync)
   - Smart Comfort Analytics
4. Wait for reset time (check `sensor.tado_ce_api_reset`)
5. Ensure only one HA instance is using the account

---

### Issue: Reset Time Incorrect

**Possible Causes:**
1. Not enough API call history
2. First time setup (no reset detected yet)
3. API call history cleared

**Solution:**
1. Wait 24-48 hours for reset time detection
2. Check `sensor.tado_ce_api_reset` attributes for detection method
3. Verify API call history is being recorded
4. Check HA logs for reset time calculation messages
5. Reset time will be more accurate after first detected reset

---

### Issue: Schedule Calendar Not Showing Events

**Possible Causes:**
1. Schedule Calendar not enabled
2. No schedules configured in Tado app
3. Calendar integration not loaded

**Solution:**
1. Enable "Enable Schedule Calendar" in configuration
