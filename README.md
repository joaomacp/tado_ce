## Why Tado CE?

Tado CE was created in response to Tado's 2025 API rate limits (100-20,000 calls/day depending on plan). The official Home Assistant integration doesn't show your actual API usage, leaving users unaware until they get blocked.

What started as an API management solution has evolved into a **comprehensive smart climate integration** with real-time rate limit tracking, smart day/night polling, comfort analytics, environment monitoring, and enhanced controls for heating, AC, and hot water.

---

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Home Assistant 2024.1+ and a Tado account with V2/V3/V3+ devices.

### 1. Install via HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=hiall-fyi&repository=tado_ce&category=integration)

1. Click the button above (or add `https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce` as a custom repository in HACS)
2. Install "Tado CE" from HACS
3. Restart Home Assistant

<details>
<summary>Manual Installation</summary>

```bash
cp -r tado_ce /config/custom_components/
```
</details>

### 2. Add Integration & Authenticate

```
Tado CE: Integration loading...
Tado CE: Polling interval set to 30m (day)
Tado CE full sync SUCCESS
Tado CE: Integration loaded successfully
```

### 4. Configure Options

## Entities

Quick overview of entities created by Tado CE:

- **Hub**: API usage/reset sensors, weather sensors, away mode switch, resume all schedules button
- **Per Zone**: Climate control, temperature/humidity, heating power, mode, battery, connection
- **Environment**: Mold risk, comfort level (always enabled)
- **Smart Comfort**: Heating/cooling rates, time-to-target, efficiency, preheat advisor, schedule sensors (opt-in)
- **Hot Water**: Water heater with AUTO/HEAT/OFF modes, timer buttons (30/60/90 min)
- **Switches**: Child lock, early start per zone

## Smart Polling

The integration automatically adjusts polling frequency based on your API limit and time of day.

| API Limit | Day (7am-11pm) | Night (11pm-7am) | Est. Calls/Day |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 100 | 30 min | 2 h | ~80 calls |
| 1,000 | 15 min | 1 h | ~160 calls |
| 5,000 | 10 min | 30 min | ~240 calls |
| 20,000 | 5 min | 15 min | ~480 calls |

<details>
<summary>100 Calls/Day Breakdown</summary>

| Time Period | Duration | Interval | Syncs | Calls | Total |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Day (7am-11pm) | 16h | 30 min | 32 | 2 | 64 |
| Night (11pm-7am) | 8h | 2h | 4 | 2 | 8 |
| Full sync | 24h | 6h | 4 | 2 | 8 |
| **Total** | | | | | **80** |

This leaves a 20% buffer for manual syncs or service calls.

</details>

| Smart Thermostat V3/V3+ | HEATING | Full |
| Smart Radiator Thermostat (SRT/VA02) | HEATING | Full |

## Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Cloud-Only | All control goes through Tado's cloud servers |
| No GPS | Device trackers only show home/not_home status |
| Rotating Tokens | If token expires, re-authentication required |
| No Schedule Management | Use Tado app for schedule changes |
| No Historical Data | Would consume too many API calls |

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Options not saving (v1.9.0+)</strong></summary>

If clicking "Submit" in Configure doesn't show "Successfully saved", the **Outdoor Temperature Entity** field may be empty.

**This is a Home Assistant Core limitation** ([Issue #154795](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/154795)) - EntitySelector cannot handle empty values.

**Workaround:**
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE → Configure**
2. Expand **Smart Comfort Settings**
3. Set **Outdoor Temperature Entity** to any weather entity (e.g., `weather.home`)
4. Click **Submit**

If you don't want weather compensation, set "Smart Comfort Mode" to "None".

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Token refresh failed / Re-authentication required</strong></summary>

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Tado CE**
2. Click **Configure** or look for re-authentication prompt
3. Follow the device authorization flow (link + code)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>No device tracker entities</strong></summary>

Device trackers only appear for mobile devices with geo tracking enabled in the Tado app.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enable debug logging</strong></summary>

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.tado_ce: debug
```

Restart Home Assistant and check **Settings > System > Logs**.

</details>

For other issues, check logs at **Settings > System > Logs** (filter by "tado_ce") or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues).
