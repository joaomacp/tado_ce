## Why Tado CE?

Tado CE was created in response to Tado's 2025 API rate limits (100-20,000 calls/day depending on plan). The official Home Assistant integration doesn't show your actual API usage, leaving users unaware until they get blocked.

What started as an API management solution has evolved into a **comprehensive smart climate integration** with real-time rate limit tracking, smart day/night polling, comfort analytics, environment monitoring, and enhanced controls for heating, AC, and hot water.

---

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Home Assistant 2024.1+ and a Tado account with V2/V3/V3+ devices.

### 1. Install via HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=hiall-fyi&repository=tado_ce&category=integration)

1. Click the button above (or add `https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce` as a custom repository in HACS)
2. Install "Tado CE" from HACS
3. Restart Home Assistant

<details>
<summary>Manual Installation</summary>

```bash
cp -r tado_ce /config/custom_components/
```
</details>

### 2. Add Integration & Authenticate

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration**
2. Search for **Tado CE** and click **Submit**
3. Visit `https://login.tado.com/device` and enter the code shown
4. Authorize in your browser, then click **Submit**
5. If you have multiple homes, select which one to use

That's it! No SSH required.

### 3. Verify Success

Check **Settings > System > Logs** for:

```
Tado CE: Integration loading...
Tado CE: Polling interval set to 30m (day)
Tado CE full sync SUCCESS

---

## Entities

Quick overview of entities created by Tado CE:

- **Hub**: API usage/reset/sync sensors, weather sensors, away mode switch, resume all schedules button
- **Per Zone**: Climate control, temperature/humidity, heating power, mode, battery, connection
- **Environment**: Mold risk, comfort level (always enabled)
- **Smart Comfort**: Heating/cooling rates, time-to-target, efficiency, preheat advisor, schedule sensors (opt-in)
- **Hot Water**: Water heater with AUTO/HEAT/OFF modes, timer buttons (30/60/90 min)
- **Switches**: Child lock, early start per zone

**New in v2.0.0**: 
- **API Monitoring Sensors**: Next/Last Sync, Polling Interval, Call History, API Call Breakdown - no templates required!
- **Thermal Analytics**: Heating rate analysis, thermal inertia, preheat estimates with confidence scoring (TRV zones only)
- **Quota Reserve Protection**: Automatically pauses polling when quota critically low (≤5% or ≤5 calls), reserves quota for manual operations, auto-resumes after API reset

**New in v2.1.0**:
- **Per-Zone Configuration**: Heating type, overlay mode, temperature limits, UFH buffer, temp offset per zone
- **Condensation Risk Sensor**: Dew point-based condensation warning for AC zones
- **Zone Features Toggles**: Control entity visibility (diagnostics, controls, boost, environment, thermal, zone config)

## Smart Polling

**v2.0.0**: Adaptive Smart Polling with Quota Reserve Protection - real-time interval calculation based on remaining API quota.

### The Design Philosophy

- **Real-time Adaptive**: Calculates interval before each sync based on remaining quota, distributes remaining calls over remaining time, self-healing for any usage pattern
- **Universal**: Works for ANY quota tier (100, 5000, 20000) - no hardcoded tiers or special cases
- **Simple & Predictable**: Easy to understand, transparent through debug logging

### What This Means For You

| Quota | Typical Interval | Daily Utilization |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 100 | ~16 min | ~90 calls (90%) |
| 5000 | ~5 min | ~576 calls |
| 20000 | 5 min (minimum) | Prevents excessive polling |

**Self-healing**: If you make manual API calls, it automatically slows down. End of day uses remaining quota efficiently.

### Safety Mechanisms

- **Minimum interval**: 5 min (prevents excessive polling even with high quotas)
- **Maximum interval**: 120 min (ensures reasonable update frequency)
- **Safety buffer**: 10% reserve for manual operations
- **Low quota protection**: Automatically slows down when quota is low
- **Quota Reserve Protection**: Pauses polling when quota critically low (≤5% or ≤5 calls), reserves quota for manual operations (set temperature, etc.), automatically resumes after API reset

### Optional Features Impact

- **Weather sensors**: Automatically accounts for extra API call
- **Mobile device tracking**: Automatically adjusts for additional calls
- **Smart Comfort**: No impact (local computation only)

### Custom Intervals

Override adaptive polling with fixed intervals in **Settings > Devices & Services > Tado CE > Configure > Polling Schedule**:
- Custom Day Interval (7am-11pm default)
- Custom Night Interval (11pm-7am default)

### Monitoring

New sensors let you monitor polling behavior:
- `sensor.tado_ce_polling_interval` - Current interval with source
- `sensor.tado_ce_next_sync` - Next sync time with countdown
- `sensor.tado_ce_call_history` - API call statistics

## Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Cloud-Only | All control goes through Tado's cloud servers |
| No GPS | Device trackers only show home/not_home status |
| Rotating Tokens | If token expires, re-authentication required |
| No Schedule Management | Use Tado app for schedule changes |
| No Historical Data | Would consume too many API calls |

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Options not saving (v1.9.0+)</strong></summary>

If clicking "Submit" in Configure doesn't show "Successfully saved", the **Outdoor Temperature Entity** field may be empty.

**This is a Home Assistant Core limitation** ([Issue #154795](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/154795)) - EntitySelector cannot handle empty values.

**Workaround:**
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE → Configure**
2. Expand **Smart Comfort Settings**
3. Set **Outdoor Temperature Entity** to any weather entity (e.g., `weather.home`)
4. Click **Submit**

If you don't want weather compensation, set "Smart Comfort Mode" to "None".

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Token refresh failed / Re-authentication required</strong></summary>

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Tado CE**
2. Click **Configure** or look for re-authentication prompt
3. Follow the device authorization flow (link + code)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>No device tracker entities</strong></summary>

Device trackers only appear for mobile devices with geo tracking enabled in the Tado app.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enable debug logging</strong></summary>

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.tado_ce: debug
```

Restart Home Assistant and check **Settings > System > Logs**.

</details>

For other issues, check logs at **Settings > System > Logs** (filter by "tado_ce") or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues).
