# Changelog

All notable changes to Tado CE will be documented in this file.

## [1.9.0-dev] - In Development

**Smart Comfort Analytics + Insights** - Complete Smart Comfort suite with analytics and predictive insights for both Heating and AC zones.

### Smart Comfort Analytics (Phase 1+2)
- **Heating Rate Sensor** - °C/hour when heating is active
- **Cooling Rate Sensor** - °C/hour when heating is off (heat loss rate)
- **Time to Target Sensor** - Estimated minutes to reach target temperature (zones with TRV only)
- **Comfort at Risk Binary Sensor** - Alert when target may be missed
- **Heating Efficiency Sensor** - Compare current vs baseline rate (detect anomalies)
- **Configurable Comfort Thresholds** - Set min/max comfort temperatures for zones without TRV
- **Weather Compensation** - Adjust predictions based on outdoor temperature
- **Unit Conversions** - Automatic conversion for Fahrenheit and various wind speed units

### Smart Comfort Insights (Phase 3) - NEW
- **Historical Temperature Comparison** - Compare current temp vs 7-day same-time average
- **Preheat Advisor** - Suggest optimal preheat start time based on historical warm-up patterns
- **Smart Comfort Target Sensor** - Compensated target temperature based on outdoor temp + humidity
- **Smart Comfort Mode** - Preset-based comfort optimization (None/Light/Moderate/Aggressive)

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed API reset detection for 100-call limit** - Dynamic threshold now works with both 5000 and 100 call limits ([#54](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/54))
- **Fixed Refresh AC Capabilities not tracked** - Button API calls now recorded in call history ([#61](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/61))
- **Fixed temperature offset for multi-TRV rooms** - Offset now applied to ALL devices in a zone, not just the first one ([#66](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/66))
- **Fixed device sensor assignment** - Battery/Connection sensors now assigned to HEATING zones over HOT_WATER when device serves multiple zones ([#56](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/56))
- **AC turn-off debug logging** - Added detailed logging to diagnose intermittent restore-to-ON issue ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44))
- **Optimized heating zone API calls** - Setting temperature with hvac_mode now uses single API call instead of two (saves 1% quota per action)
- **Fixed AC HEAT_COOL mode hvac_action** - Optimistic updates now correctly set hvac_action to IDLE for HEAT_COOL mode (Tado AUTO)
- **Fixed negative heating rate during active heating** - Heating rate now clamped to >= 0 (sensor lag cannot cause negative rates)

### Internal Improvements
- **Smart Comfort per-home isolation** - SmartHeatingManager now accessed via `hass.data` instead of global singleton, preparing for multi-home support

## [1.8.3] - 2026-01-26

**AC Optimistic Updates & Cached Capabilities** - Complete AC state feedback and reduced restart API calls.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-01-26

**AC Optimistic Updates Enhancement & Resume All Schedules Fix** - Improved AC state feedback and faster button response.

- **Enhanced AC optimistic updates** - When turning AC on from OFF, temperature/fan mode/hvac action now update immediately (not just mode) ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @neonsp)

- **Fixed Resume All Schedules not refreshing** - Button now properly triggers immediate refresh ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @hapklaar)
- AC state changes (temperature, mode, fan, swing) now update immediately without bouncing back
