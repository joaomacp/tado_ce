# Changelog

All notable changes to Tado CE will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - TBD

**Smart Polling, Mold Risk Enhancement & Thermal Analytics** - Adaptive polling, surface temperature calculation, and unified thermal analysis.

### Features
- **API Monitoring Sensors** - New sensors for tracking API sync and polling ([Discussion #86](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/discussions/86), [#65](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/65))
  - `sensor.tado_ce_next_sync` - Next API sync time with countdown
  - `sensor.tado_ce_last_sync` - Last API sync time with time ago and sync status
  - `sensor.tado_ce_polling_interval` - Current polling interval with source
  - `sensor.tado_ce_call_history` - API call history with statistics
  - `sensor.tado_ce_api_call_breakdown` - API call breakdown by type (zoneStates, weather, etc.) with 24h/today/total counts
  - No templates required - build dashboards directly
  - Compatible with Activity card for visualization
- **Thermal Analytics** - Unified thermal analysis with first-order and second-order metrics
  - New sensors: `_thermal_inertia`, `_avg_heating_rate`, `_preheat_time`, `_analysis_confidence`, `_heating_acceleration`, `_approach_factor`
  - TRV-only: Thermal analytics only for zones with TRV devices (not SU02 Smart Thermostat)
- **Adaptive Smart Polling** - Real-time polling interval based on remaining API quota ([#89](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/89) - @ChrisMarriott38)
  - Universal quota support: works with any API tier (100, 200, 500, 5000, 20000+)
  - Self-healing: automatically adjusts if usage spikes or quota changes
- **Enhanced Mold Risk** - Surface temperature calculation for accurate cold spot detection ([#90](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/90) - @ChrisMarriott38)
  - Uses outdoor temp + window U-value to estimate cold spot temperature at window edges
  - Window type config: Single Pane, Double Pane (default), Triple Pane, Passive House

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed per-home data file loading after migration** - All file read/write operations now correctly use per-home file paths instead of legacy paths
- **Fixed hot water timer buttons not finding entity** - Timer buttons now use entity registry lookup instead of constructing entity ID from zone name, fixing cases where HA adds suffix like `_2` ([#93](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/93) - @Fred224)
- **Fixed Smart Boost button not finding climate entity** - Smart Boost now uses entity registry lookup with name-based fallback, consistent with water heater timer fix
- **Improved heating rate fallback chain** - Preheat Advisor and Smart Boost now prioritize HeatingCycleCoordinator data, falling back to SmartComfortManager when unavailable
- **Fixed threading issue in entity freshness cleanup** - Changed cleanup scheduler to use `hass.loop.call_soon_threadsafe()` to properly schedule tasks from executor thread, eliminating "hass.async_create_task from a thread" errors

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Fixed all blocking I/O in async context** - All file operations now properly use async_add_executor_job or aiofiles
- **Improved error handling** - File loading now uses specific exception handling (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, JSONDecodeError) instead of generic Exception catching
- **Added coordinator availability logging** - Warning logged when TRV zones can't create thermal analytics sensors due to coordinator unavailability
- **Sequence number overflow protection** - Global sequence counter resets at sys.maxsize to prevent memory issues in long-running instances
- **Entity freshness memory leak prevention** - Periodic cleanup task (every 5 minutes) removes expired entries from entity freshness tracking dict
- **Fixed setup timeout issue** - Changed cleanup task from blocking while loop to proper Home Assistant timer pattern using async_track_time_interval

### Setup & Polish
- **Removed 'Tado CE' prefix from entity names** - Hub sensors now use cleaner names (e.g., 'API Usage' instead of 'Tado CE API Usage')
- **Auto-assign areas to zone devices** - Automatically matches zone names to Home Assistant areas during setup using fuzzy matching (70% confidence threshold). Skips zones that already have areas assigned. ([#14](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/14))

### Technical Changes
- **100% Native Async I/O** - All file operations now use `aiofiles` instead of `run_in_executor`
- **Per-Home File Migration** - Legacy files renamed to per-home format (e.g., `zones.json` → `zones_{home_id}.json`)
- **Deprecated Sensor Cleanup** - Migration removes old sensors (`_thermal_rate`, `_cooling_rate`, `_heating_efficiency`, `_time_to_target`, etc.)
- **Removed Legacy Files** - Deleted `tado_api.py` (replaced by `async_api.py`) and `error_handler.py`

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-05

**Coordinator Race Condition Fix** - Complete architectural fix for climate entity flickering and state sync issues.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed coordinator race condition causing climate entity flickering** - Implemented 3-layer defense strategy to prevent stale coordinator data from overwriting user actions ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @hapklaar, @chinezbrun, @neonsp)
  - **Layer 1: Coordinator-level freshness tracking** - Entities marked "fresh" after user actions skip coordinator updates for 17 seconds
  - **Layer 2: Sequence number tracking** - Each coordinator update has monotonically increasing sequence number, entities reject lower sequences
  - **Layer 3: Explicit state confirmation** - Entities track expected state and only clear optimistic state when API confirms the exact expected state
- **Fixed state not syncing after mode changes** - Climate entities now properly sync with Tado API state after user actions
- **Fixed optimistic updates not working consistently** - Optimistic state now persists correctly until API confirmation
- **Fixed heating power stuck after mode change** - Heating power sensor now updates correctly after climate mode changes
- **Fixed grey loading state during rapid changes** - UI no longer shows grey loading state when quickly changing modes
- **Fixed rapid mode changes causing confusion** - Multiple rapid changes (HEAT→OFF→AUTO) now handled correctly with final state preserved

### Why v1.9.5-v1.9.7 Failed
Previous versions attempted time-based optimistic windows, but couldn't handle:
- **Race conditions** - Coordinator updates arriving before API confirmation
- **Out-of-order responses** - API responses arriving in different order than requests
- **Rapid changes** - Multiple user actions within coordinator polling interval
- **Environmental factors** - Network latency (Home→ISP→Tado) varying by location, ISP routing, HA load

### Technical Details
- Added `_entity_freshness` dict and `_global_sequence` counter to coordinator
- Added `mark_entity_fresh()`, `is_entity_fresh()`, `get_next_sequence()` coordinator methods
- Added optimistic state tracking to both `TadoClimate` and `TadoACClimate` classes
- Coordinator attaches sequence numbers to all zone data updates
- Entities check freshness before accepting coordinator updates
- Entities reject updates with lower sequence numbers than current optimistic sequence
- Entities track expected state and only clear optimistic state on exact match
- **16 property-based tests** validate correctness across all edge cases
- **3 live functional tests** verify real-world behavior with actual HA instance

### Performance Impact
- **Reduced API calls** - Fresh entities skip unnecessary updates
- **Faster UI response** - Optimistic updates provide immediate feedback
- **Better multi-zone handling** - Independent freshness tracking per entity

## [1.9.7] - 2026-02-04

**Explicit Optimistic State Tracking** - Fixed flickering/wrong state preservation after mode changes.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed state flickering when rapidly changing modes** - Thermostat no longer flickers between states when quickly switching modes (HEAT → OFF → AUTO) ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @chinezbrun)
- **Fixed wrong state preservation after mode change** - When setting OFF mode, the system no longer incorrectly preserves the previous HEAT state

### Technical Changes
- **Explicit optimistic state tracking** - Instead of just tracking "when" (time-based), we now track "what" (state-based)
  - Added `_optimistic_hvac_mode` and `_optimistic_hvac_action` to track expected state
  - `update()` now only preserves state when API hasn't confirmed the SPECIFIC expected state
  - For OFF/AUTO modes, API confirmation is immediate (no preservation needed)
  - For HEAT mode, only preserve HEATING action if API shows IDLE (boiler hasn't fired yet)
- **Centralized state management** - Added `_set_optimistic_state()` and `_clear_optimistic_state()` helper methods

### Root Cause Analysis
v1.9.6's time-based optimistic window (`_optimistic_set_at`) didn't track WHAT state to preserve. When user set OFF mode, the window was still active from a previous HEAT action, causing `update()` to incorrectly preserve the old HEAT state instead of accepting the new OFF state.

## [1.9.6] - 2026-02-04

**Optimistic Update Consistency Fix** - Fixed hvac_action reverting after state changes.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed hvac_action reverting to IDLE after state change** - When setting temperature higher than current, hvac_action now stays at "Heating" consistently instead of reverting to "Idle" after ~17 seconds ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @hapklaar, @chinezbrun)

### Improvements
- **Improved state consistency for all entity types** - Hot water and switch entities now have the same optimistic update protection as climate entities, preventing UI bounce-back after user actions
- **Better API failure handling** - All entities now properly rollback to previous state if API call fails
- **Added Known Issue warning in Configure dialog** - Options page now shows warning about EntitySelector limitation with link to workaround ([Discussion #76](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/discussions/76))

## [1.9.5] - 2026-02-02

**Hotfix: hvac_action not updating for changed zone** - Optimistic updates now set hvac_action correctly when setting temperature.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed hvac_action not updating for the zone being changed** - When setting temperature higher than current, hvac_action now immediately shows "Heating" instead of staying "Idle" until the next zone change ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @hapklaar, @chinezbrun)
  - Heating zones: hvac_action = HEATING when target > current temperature
  - AC zones: hvac_action matches current mode (COOLING/HEATING/DRYING/FAN)
  - The actual heating_power/ac_power will be confirmed when zones.json is refreshed

## [1.9.4] - 2026-02-02

**Boost Buttons & Bug Fixes** - One-tap boost functionality and state confirmation improvements.

### New Features
- **Boost Button** - Official Tado-style boost: sets zone to 25°C for 30 minutes, then resumes schedule
- **Smart Boost Button** - Intelligent boost with calculated duration based on heating rate
  - Duration = `(target - current) / heating_rate`
  - Capped between 15 minutes and 3 hours to prevent runaway heating
  - Uses schedule target or current + 3°C if no target available

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed hvac_action stuck on "Heating" after switching to Auto** - Optimistic update now sets hvac_action to IDLE when switching to AUTO mode ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @hapklaar)
- **Fixed AC startup validation warnings** - Set default fan/swing modes to suppress "Fan mode is not valid" warnings on HA restart ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @neonsp)
- **Fixed slow zone sensor updates** - Zone sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Heating Power, AC Power) now update immediately after actions instead of waiting 30 seconds ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @chinezbrun)

## [1.9.3] - 2026-02-02

**Fix: Slow State Confirmation for Heating Users** ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44)) - Signal-based entity update reduces confirmation delay from 25-30s to ~6-8s.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed slow state confirmation for Heating users** - Climate entities now update immediately after zones.json refresh instead of waiting for SCAN_INTERVAL (30s) ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @hapklaar, @chinezbrun)
- **Fixed AC DRY mode 422 error** - DRY mode now checks capabilities to determine if temperature is required ([#79](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/79) - @Fred224, @neonsp)
- **Fixed AC optimistic update for Fan/Dry modes** - Temperature display now clears immediately when switching to modes that don't support temperature ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @neonsp)

## [1.9.2] - 2026-02-01

**Hotfix: Grey Loading State & Cache Deduplication** - Fixed climate control delays and Smart Comfort cache bloat.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed grey loading state issue** - Climate mode changes (Auto → Off) now respond immediately instead of 15-20 second delay ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @chinezbrun)
  - Changed from fire-and-forget to await pattern for API calls
  - Service calls now await API completion (with 10s timeout) for proper HA Frontend state sync
  - Optimistic updates still fire immediately, but service call waits for confirmation
  - Fixed race condition: refresh failures no longer trigger rollback when API call succeeded
- **Fixed Smart Comfort cache bloat** - Deduplicate readings on cache load and skip duplicate readings (same temp/heating state within 5 minutes)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-01-31

**Hotfix: Device Migration Error** - Fixed crash on startup for some users.

- **Fixed device identifier parsing** - Device migration code now handles non-standard identifier formats ([#74](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/74))

### ⚠️ Known Issue: Options Not Saving

If options don't save after clicking Submit, set a valid entity in **Smart Comfort Settings → Outdoor Temperature Entity**. This is a [Home Assistant Core limitation](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/154795) - EntitySelector cannot handle empty values. ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @chinezbrun, @pkmetski)
